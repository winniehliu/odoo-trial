This project is for Odoo's Web Designer Assignment


About the mockup:

I really love the overall cleanliness of the design: spacing, typography, colors. I love that it incorporates slanted edges to remove the rigidness of normal websites.

If this is a real website, I'd want to make the card on the hero changes name, location, and currency according to the user location.

The "Play Video" buttons are good to let users know that these are indeed, videos. I'd make it playable if user clicks on the whole image instead of just the button, and perhaps change the button into just a decorative span. 


Changes:

I left the green badges text color to dark instead of white as shown in the mockup. The white text on light green pill badge is not contrasting enough and will create visibility issue. Some interesting read: https://spotify.design/article/better-in-black-rethinking-our-most-important-buttons
